#Shop@NUS - a one stop NUS marketplace and advertising platform

## Inspiration
We got frustrated by the multiple telegram chats (like NUS Marketplace, NUS FASS) that promote different groups selling items and overall just spamming and resending messages multiple times in a week and realised that there's no one-stop platform in NUS that connects the overall NUS marketplace, which includes, but is not limited to, faculty sales, community sales and fundraiser sales.
## What it does
We realised the lack of a centralised platform for NUS sales, especially student-initiated fundraisers and created a one-stop marketplace platform for NUS students. Other forms of sales, like faculty sales, garner much more visibility and we would like to provide fundraisers with the same amount of attention. We have intentionally added project details for listings categorised under fundraisers in hopes of giving these groups an opportunity to be seen.

## How we built it
Frontend: React, MUI, Bootstrap (with custom styling)
Backend: Firebase


## Challenges we ran into
Backend.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We managed to finish our first coding project in 24 hours! We intentionally chose a technically-demanding project to challenge ourselves and we are really satisfied that we have something nice to show to the judges :D

## What we learned
Intricacies of full-stack development.
Developing the features of our product from the user's point of view.

## What's next for Shop@NUS
Expand the categories for our products and include a calendar for sellers to provide dates of pop-ups, opening and closing of order forms etc and students can star fundraisers that they are interested in. Eventually, we plan to develop a mobile app where students can receive notifications from groups/sales they have "starred" or are interested in, as well as including a messaging chat bot for students to directly contact sellers. We are also considering in-app payment, as well as using machine learning algorithms to provide personalised recommendations for users.
